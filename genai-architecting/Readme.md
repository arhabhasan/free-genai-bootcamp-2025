## Functional Requirements
The company wants to check their new product i.e. English to French tutor platform. This platform enables users to learn French language easily without no or minimum need of external tutors. They are exploring the GenAI features as well to make the product more effective and engaging.
However, at the start they want to explore all the free tier of the LLMs, and as the number of users grow, they can also adapt to paid version of these AI powered assistants (LLMs)

## Assumptions
We are assuming that Open-source LLMs can handle up to 50 students efficiently but then we must move to a paid version for better services.
As OpenAI is the leading in the AI industry, we think that it will be the best option for this solution.

## Data Strategy
There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and
supply materials and store them for access to our database.
